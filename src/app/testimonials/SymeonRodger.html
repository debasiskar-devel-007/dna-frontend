    Jack and I have worked together several times over the past five years. At one point I was privileged to attend his "Zufelt Experience" three day event, where he takes participants through an intense transformational process focusing on one particular issue in their own lives.
<br/><br/>
The results were amazing! This was indeed "life-changing" for many who attended, helping them break out of ruts and emotional prisons they had been in for years. Jack is a very gifted speaker, presenter and catalyst for transformation, one of the best I've seen. And I don't say that lightly - as a frequent presenter at the annual Energy Psychology Conference in Toronto and as someone who has co-presented with some of the top figures in personal transformation, I can tell you Jack Zufelt is indeed one of the best.

<br/><br/>
Moreover, he's a great friend, a man of integrity and has great business acumen as well. Working with Jack, you won't be disappointed!
